# AUTO-INFANT-CPR-SOFTWARE
The aim is to write a program using the arduino IDE to operate a neonatal chest compression device.
The program operates the device by producing 30 chest compressions as one cycle and pauses for 4 seconds for rescue breaths to be given.
The cycles should be endless until a stronger pulse is detected or patient resuscitates.
The user should be able to terminate or stop the chest compressions at anytime.
Information should be displayed to the user when chest compression is ongoing and when it's time to provide rescue breaths.
